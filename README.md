## 📌 Project Purpose

The AclTime Pro project aims to explore and analyze time-based alcohol clearance estimation using established mathematical approaches.

The application is intended for:
- Educational purposes
- Scientific and exploratory analysis
- Personal awareness and research contexts

⚠️ **Important Notice**  
AclTime Pro is not a medical device and does not replace laboratory tests, breathalyzers, or legal assessments.  
All results are approximate and non-diagnostic.

## 🔬 Methodological Overview

The estimation process implemented in AclTime Pro is based on:
- Mathematical models of alcohol metabolism
- User-defined parameters (e.g. body mass, biological sex, consumption timing)
- Time-based clearance estimation algorithms

The system distinguishes between:
- **Simulation-based estimates**
- **Externally measured data** (when available)

This project is classified as **non-clinical and exploratory**.
